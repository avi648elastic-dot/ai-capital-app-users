## 🔍 How to Check Render Deployment Status

### Option 1: Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Log in with your account
3. Find your service: `ai-capital-app7` (or your backend service name)
4. Check the "Events" tab for deployment status

### Option 2: Check Deployment Logs
1. In Render dashboard, click on your service
2. Go to "Logs" tab
3. Look for:
   - ✅ "Build succeeded"
   - ✅ "Deploy succeeded"
   - ✅ "Live"

## 🐛 Common Deployment Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Symptoms:** Build logs show TypeScript errors or npm install failures

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test build locally first
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
```

If local build works, the issue might be:
- Missing environment variables in Render
- Node version mismatch

**Solution:**
- Check Render environment variables match `.env.example`
- Ensure Node version is set to 20.x in Render settings

### Issue 2: Service Starts But Crashes
**Symptoms:** Build succeeds but service keeps restarting

**Common Causes:**
1. **MongoDB Connection Failed**
   - Check `MONGODB_URI` in Render environment variables
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows Render's IP addresses

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Check all required variables are set in Render:
     - `MONGODB_URI`
     - `JWT_SECRET`
     - `REDIS_URL` (optional, but recommended)
     - `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`
     - `FINNHUB_API_KEY`
     - `FMP_API_KEY`

3. **Port Configuration**
   - Render automatically sets `PORT` environment variable
   - Our code uses `process.env.PORT || 10000`

### Issue 3: Redis Connection Errors
**Symptoms:** Logs show "Redis connection failed"

**This is NORMAL and NON-CRITICAL:**
- The app is designed to work without Redis
- Redis is optional for caching and distributed locks
- If you see this, the app will still function normally

**To Fix (Optional):**
1. Create a Redis service in Render
2. Add `REDIS_URL` to environment variables
3. Uncomment Redis configuration in `render.yaml`

### Issue 4: Frontend Not Updating
**Symptoms:** Backend deployed but frontend still shows old version

**Vercel Deployment:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: `ai-capital-app7-frontend`
3. Check if deployment is triggered
4. If not, manually trigger:
   ```bash
   # From your local machine
   cd frontend
   vercel --prod
   ```

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Trigger

If Render doesn't auto-deploy, you can trigger manually:

### Option 1: Render Dashboard
1. Go to your service in Render
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Select "Deploy latest commit"

### Option 2: Force Push (Last Resort)
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Health Check

Once deployed, verify the service is running:

### Backend Health Check:
```bash
curl https://ai-capital-app7.onrender.com/healthz
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": "123 seconds",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T..."
}
```

### Frontend Health Check:
Visit: https://ai-capital-app7-frontend.vercel.app

You should see:
- ✅ Acacia tree logo in header
- ✅ Market status bar at top
- ✅ Animated businessman
- ✅ Feature tooltips on hover (for locked items)

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If the new deployment has critical issues:

### Render Rollback:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Events" tab
4. Find previous successful deployment
5. Click "Rollback to this deploy"

### Git Rollback:
```bash
# Find the previous commit
git log --oneline

# Rollback to previous commit (replace COMMIT_HASH)
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## 📝 Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure these are set in Render:

### Required:
- ✅ `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT tokens
- ✅ `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
- ✅ `PORT` - Automatically set by Render (usually 10000)

### API Keys (Required for stock data):
- ✅ `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`
- ✅ `FINNHUB_API_KEY`
- ✅ `FMP_API_KEY`

### Optional:
- ⚪ `REDIS_URL` - For caching (app works without it)
- ⚪ `SENTRY_DSN` - For error tracking
- ⚪ `EMAIL_USER` - For email notifications
- ⚪ `EMAIL_PASS` - For email notifications

## 🎯 Expected Deployment Time

- **Build Time:** 2-5 minutes
- **Deploy Time:** 30-60 seconds
- **Total:** ~3-6 minutes

## 📞 Need Help?

If deployment fails after 10 minutes:

1. **Check Render Logs:**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Share the error logs for debugging

2. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to your repo → Actions tab
   - See if any CI/CD checks failed

3. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## ✅ Deployment Success Indicators

You'll know deployment succeeded when:

1. ✅ Render dashboard shows "Live" status
2. ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
3. ✅ Frontend loads without errors
4. ✅ You can log in and see the new features:
   - Acacia tree logo
   - Market status bar
   - Animated businessman
