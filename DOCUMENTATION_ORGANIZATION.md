## 💡 Best Practices

### When Creating New Documentation

1. **Determine category:**
   - Email/Notifications → `/docs/email/`
   - Deployment/DevOps → `/docs/deployment/`
   - Payments/Stripe → `/docs/payments/`
   - TODOs/Sprints → `/docs/project-management/`
   - New features → `/docs/features/`
   - Architecture/Technical → `/docs/`

2. **Use clear naming:**
   - Start with category: `FEATURE_NAME_GUIDE.md`
   - Be descriptive: `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Use consistent patterns

3. **Update navigation:**
   - Add to `/docs/README.md`
   - Update main `README.md` if needed

4. **Keep it organized:**
   - One topic per file
   - Link between related docs
   - Update table of contents
