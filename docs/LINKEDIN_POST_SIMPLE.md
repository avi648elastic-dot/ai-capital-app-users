üöÄ **I built an AI portfolio manager that analyzes stocks like a Wall Street analyst**

After 6 months of coding, AI Capital is live with 6 intelligent engines working together to optimize your investments.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Engine**
Calculates returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown across 7/30/60/90 days.

**Formula:**
- Return = (EndPrice / StartPrice - 1) √ó 100
- Volatility = StdDev(dailyReturns) √ó ‚àö252
- Sharpe = (Return - RiskFree) / Volatility

**Result:** Know exactly how each stock performs across all timeframes.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Engine**
BUY/HOLD/SELL signals based on multi-factor analysis.

**Formula:**
- Score = ResistanceLevel(30%) + Momentum(25%) + VolAdjusted(20%) + Beta(15%) + Diversification(10%)
- BUY if score ‚â• 1.5
- SELL if score ‚â§ -1.5

**Result:** Clear action for every stock with confidence scoring.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Management**
Position sizing to maximize profit, minimize risk.

**Formula:**
- RiskScore = Volatility(0-2) + Drawdown(0-2) + Weight(0-1)
- RiskAdjustedReturn = StockReturn / Volatility
- Recommendation: INCREASE good stocks, REDUCE bad stocks

**Result:** Specific recommendations like "Reduce XYZ from 35% to 20%, secure $2,450 profit"

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Analysis**
Sector allocation with real ETF performance tracking.

**Formula:**
- SectorAllocation% = (SectorValue / TotalValue) √ó 100
- ETF Performance = Real 90-day return from XLK, XLI, XLY, etc.
- PortfolioVolatility = Œ£(StockVol √ó Weight)

**Result:** See which sectors you're exposed to and how they're performing.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Balance Sheet Health**
Financial health scoring from company fundamentals.

**Formula:**
- CurrentRatio = Assets / Liabilities (GOOD > 1.5)
- DebtToEquity = Debt / Equity (GOOD < 1.0)
- ROE = NetIncome / Equity (GOOD > 15%)
- HealthScore = Liquidity(30%) + Solvency(30%) + Profit(25%) + Growth(15%)

**Result:** Automated checklist showing which stocks are financially healthy.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Quality Scoring**
Ranks all your stocks from best to worst.

**Formula:**
- QualityScore = Sharpe(30%) + Return(25%) + LowVol(25%) + LowDrawdown(10%) + RiskAdjReturn(10%)
- 75-100 = EXCELLENT, 60-75 = GOOD, 40-60 = FAIR, 0-40 = POOR

**Result:** Ranks like "#1 AAPL (EXCELLENT, 85/100) - INCREASE to 15%" or "#8 XYZ (POOR, 32/100) - REDUCE to 10%"

---

## **üéØ Real Example**

You own AAPL at $271:
1. Performance: +6.8% return, 23.5% volatility, 0.81 Sharpe
2. Decision: Score +2.83 ‚Üí **BUY**
3. Quality: 57.8/100 ‚Üí **FAIR** (Ranks #3/6)
4. Sector: Technology (XLK +14.64%)
5. Balance Sheet: Current ratio 1.8, ROE 16% ‚Üí **GOOD**
6. Risk: You have 8% allocation ‚Üí **HOLD** (optimal for quality level)

**AI Recommendation:** "AAPL shows BUY signal with FAIR quality. HOLD current 8% position."
