üß† **Case Study: Building a Production-Ready AI Portfolio Management System**

Just launched AI Capital - a comprehensive investment analytics platform. Here's the technical architecture:

**System Architecture:**

   - Fetches 120 days of historical data
   - Calculates: returns, volatility, Sharpe, max drawdown, top price
   - Single API call per stock per day (saves 99% of API calls)

2. **Decision Engine** (`decisionEngine.ts`)
   - Multi-factor scoring: resistance levels, momentum, volatility
   - Dynamic data fetching (no pre-loaded lists)
   - 10-minute intelligent caching
   - Confidence scoring for every recommendation

   - Removes "Other/Unknown" sectors automatically

5. **Balance Sheet Engine** (`balanceSheetAnalysisService.ts`)
   - Automated financial health checklist
   - Fetches from Financial Modeling Prep API
   - Trend analysis across multiple years
   - Professional scoring system

6. **Stock Quality Engine** (`portfolioDetails.ts`)
   - 0-100 composite quality score
   - Weighted components: Sharpe (30%), Returns (25%), Volatility (25%)
   - Ranks all positions against each other
   - Generates INCREASE/REDUCE recommendations

**Challenges Solved:**
- API rate limits ‚Üí Multi-provider fallback system
- Expensive calculations ‚Üí Daily caching engine
- Slow page loads ‚Üí Redis caching with 12-hour TTL
- Inconsistent sector data ‚Üí Dynamic classification with fallback mapping
- Extreme volatility values ‚Üí Capping and validation logic

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Lazy component loading
- Optimized MongoDB queries with indexing

**Business Model:**
- Free tier: 1 portfolio, 10 stocks
