## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS

**Working On**: Adding Zod validation schemas to all routes

**Strategy**:
1. Create comprehensive schemas for each route file
2. Apply validation to all endpoints
3. Test locally with invalid data
4. Build and verify no errors
5. Only then ask user to approve push

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for complete validation coverage

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST (Before Push)

- [ ] `npm run build` - Backend compiles
- [ ] `npm run lint` - No linting errors
- [ ] `cd frontend && npm run build` - Frontend compiles
- [ ] Manual test: Login flow
- [ ] Manual test: Portfolio CRUD
- [ ] Manual test: Watchlist alerts
- [ ] Manual test: Admin dashboard
- [ ] Manual test: Mobile responsive
- [ ] Check browser console - No errors
- [ ] Check backend logs - No errors
- [ ] Test with invalid API payloads

**Only when ALL tests pass → Ask user for push approval**
