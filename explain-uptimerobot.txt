How UptimeRobot Keeps Your Render Service Awake

==========================================

STEP 1: Your Backend Has a Special URL
---------------------------------------
URL: https://ai-capital-app7.onrender.com/healthz

This is a simple endpoint that says "I'm alive!"


STEP 2: What Happens When UptimeRobot Pings It
-----------------------------------------------
Every 5 minutes, UptimeRobot does this:

1. Sends HTTP request: GET /healthz
2. Your backend receives the request
3. Backend wakes up (starts running if it was sleeping)
4. Backend responds: {"status": "OK"}
5. Render thinks: "Someone is using this service"
6. Render keeps the service running (doesn't let it sleep)

Think of it like this:
- 😴 Your backend falls asleep after 15 mins of inactivity
- 🔔 UptimeRobot pings it every 5 mins
- ✅ Backend never sleeps because it keeps getting "woken up"


STEP 3: Why This Fixes Your 502 Errors
---------------------------------------
Before UptimeRobot:
- User visits your app
- Backend is sleeping 😴
- Request fails with 502 error ❌

After UptimeRobot:
- UptimeRobot wakes backend every 5 mins
- Backend is always ready ✅
- User's request works immediately ✅
