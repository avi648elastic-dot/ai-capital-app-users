# 🚀 Deployment Status

## Latest Push: Commit `41a21df`

## Current Status

### ⏳ Render Deployment
**Note**: Render deployments take **5-10 minutes** after each push.

Check deployment status at:
- Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
- Backend URL: https://ai-capital-app7.onrender.com
- Health Check: https://ai-capital-app7.onrender.com/health

### Expected Timeline:
- **Commit pushed**: ✅ Done (41a21df)
- **Render detects changes**: ~30 seconds
- **Build starts**: ~1 minute
- **Build completes**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Deploy completes**: ~5-10 minutes total

## If You're Seeing Errors:

### "Network error" or "Cannot connect to server"
**Reason**: Render is still building/deploying the backend

**Solution**: 
- Wait 5-10 minutes after the git push
- Check Render dashboard for deployment status
- Look for "Live" status on your service

### Once Deployed:
- ✅ Dashboard will load
- ✅ Notifications can be deleted
- ✅ Stock prices will be REAL (NVDA = $183)
- ✅ Mobile portfolio will work
- ✅ System will be stable

## Verify Deployment:

```bash
# Check if backend is live (in browser or curl):
https://ai-capital-app7.onrender.com/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

## Common Issues:

1. **"Network error"** = Backend still deploying (wait)
2. **"Failed to fetch"** = Backend still deploying (wait)
3. **Wrong stock prices** = Clear cache, backend using real APIs now
4. **Can't delete notifications** = Backend not deployed yet (wait)

---

**TL;DR**: If you're seeing network errors, the backend is probably still building on Render. Wait 5-10 minutes and refresh.
